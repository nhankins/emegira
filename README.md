# Emegira Project Prototype

Goal: Create an LLM Language Learning tool that enables users to streamline their language acquistion process.

Topics to explore: RAG (include custom notes), DDL (Data Driven Learning) with Corpora), Lesson Planning, Prompting Custom Study Goals

Starting Point: Use this Github page to track resources, progress, and sucesses. Ideally will be able to expand to other different languages and streamline task for other users.

Will start with learning Chinese for taking the HSK 4 test. Ollama facilitates local open-source LLM deployment and hosts Yi (https://ollama.com/library/yi), which is a series of large language models trained on a high-quality corpus of 3 trillion tokens that support both the English and Chinese languages.
