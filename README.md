# Emegira Project Prototype
The name for this project derives from my creative interpretation of the literal translation for the Sumerian word for the Sumerian Language : ð’…´ð’‚  (EmegÌƒir), meaning "Native Tongue."

# Goal
Create an LLM Language Learning tool that enables users to streamline their language acquistion process.

# Topics to Explore: 
RAG (include custom notes), DDL (Data Driven Learning) with Corpora), Lesson Planning, Prompting Custom Study Goals to an LLM 

# Roadmap:
- Use this Github page to track/add resources, progress, and sucesses. Ideally will be able to expand to other different languages and streamline the task for other users.

- Will start with learning Chinese for taking the HSK 4 test.
  
- Ollama facilitates local open-source LLM deployment and hosts Yi (https://ollama.com/library/yi), which is a series of large language models trained on a high-quality corpus of 3 trillion tokens that support both the English and Chinese languages.
